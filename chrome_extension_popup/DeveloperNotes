In the documentation i mentioned object-value:
object-value:
    a set of settings inside the json which sspecifies how to change a element who's marked
    or contains something that makes him change.

    For example we have on our DOM:
    <a ... aui-action="delete"> some content <a>    
    The object-value located in the profile inside aui-action attribute with value "delete'
    will be used to change this <a> element when the personalization runs on te DOM.



    aui-action:{...,

            //here is the example object-value
            "delete": { //the value of the attribute. this object value will change elements of tagname <a> that 
            //have attribute aui-action = "delete" in them.
                "name": "delete",

            /* type: A list of tagnames that the object-value affects. If the element you're trying to change isn't of those tagname,it won't be changed.
            can have 'not <tagname>' fields, for example 'not p'
            For all tagnames leave empty or enter "all".
            Usage Examples:
            "type":[],
            "type":["a","p","input"]
            "type":["not a"]
              */      
                "type": ["a"],
            /*Inhertis: may refer to another object value in the profile
             we want to use when this object value is requested by an elemen
             Usage Examples:

                        "inherits": ""//no inheritance

                        "inherits": {
                            "attributeName": "AUI-destination",

                        }//inherits from aui-destination:home object value
